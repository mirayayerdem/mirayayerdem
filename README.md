# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Miray Ayerdem, a Senior Computer Science student at Bilkent University. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I have a background in web development, with experience in both frontend and backend development. I've worked with various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks like React and Node.js. I enjoy creating intuitive and user-friendly web applications. Moreover, I have hands-on experience with Google Cloud. I've used various services like Google App Engine, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Functions for deploying web applications and managing cloud-based resources.

In addition to web development, I have research experience in software analytics. I've explored techniques to analyze software systems and extract valuable insights to improve their quality and performance.

I'm also passionate about machine learning and data engineering. I've worked on projects involving data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building predictive models. I find it fascinating to leverage data to gain meaningful insights and solve real-world problems. Now, I am working on adversarial attacks on deep learning models in order to develop more secure and reliable models.
